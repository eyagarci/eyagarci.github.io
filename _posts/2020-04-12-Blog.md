## Recommender Sytems

### Introduction
The recommendation technology has become a relatively new research area. The
techniques behind this technology have been improved over the time and have
made a significant difference in people’s lives. In general, the aim of such system is to
provide the relevant information as recommendation in a wide range of web services
through analyzing and aggregating the user’s behavior and expectations. The delivered
recommendations can facilitate the decision making process for the users who lack
sufficient personal experience and expertise. Ultimately, the recommender systems
are decision-making systems which will provide relative information easy to manage,
adapted to the user’s preferences and interests within a specific domain.

### 1- Background
Recommender systems, also called recommendation systems (RSs), appeared in
the mid-1990s as an independent research area. They play a curial role to represent
specific kind of information filtering systems which seek to provide the rating or preference
that a user would give to an item he is interested in.

Itemis a usual termwhich is used in the recommendation services or products like
movies, books, CDs, etc. It can be represented by a set of features, also called attributes
or properties. Each item is characterized by its complexity and its value (i.e. utility).
Such values can be positive if its related item is useful for the user or negative if it is
not appropriate hence, we can consider, here, that the user made a wrong decision.
RSs might also use a range of features and properties of items that can be represented
using several information and representation approaches such as a set of attributes or
concepts in an ontological representation of a domain.


The primary task of a RS is suggesting items in a personalized manner and considering
them in recommendations that best fit their individual needs and tastes. Therefore,
it requires that the system must maintain a user’s profile in order to deliver the
right recommendations. The RS is also an attempt to automatically model and technically
reproduce the process of suggestions in the real world. It can change the way to
find what users who lack sufficient experience or knowledge need in term of products
and information. For this purpose, it is usually visualized as a knowledge discovery
tool as it has the ability to build new recommendations to meet the requirements of
its users. Hence, its main objective is to search for and filter the best choices, interests,
circumstances and characteristics, considering the user’s profile. In other words,
this technology studies different patterns of behavior to comprehend what someone will prefer from a collection of things that he has never faced before. In fact, the good
personalized recommendations might add another dimension to the user’s experience
and more facilitate their routine decision-making.


### 2- Data and Information Sources
The variety of information that can be collected about a user and/or an item is very
wide. It plays an essential role to establish the efficiency of every recommendation
system for the reason that RS might not function accurately in the case where the user
model has not been well built. Ultimately, the data sources used in each RS plays a
significant role in its evaluation. It can be structured in various ways, whether they
can be appropriated or not appropriated to the user’s recommendation. They rely on
different types of data where some RSs need this data about the user, some need it
about the products and others need both. The most commonly classification of the
data is divided as below:

#### 2.1- Explicit Data
Explicit data is a methodology which is based on information and interests input by
the users themselves. Usually, the system requires that the user provides ratings
for items in order to express his judgements and build his profile (i.e. model). In this
context, several approaches have been proposed to construct and update the user’s
profile. Generally, the rating approach is one of the highlights method which are used
to predict the user’s personality. It can take several forms as follow:

- **Numerical:** This formrepresents a rating on a discrete scale like the 1-5 stars used
in Amazon.com. This rating form can be described as follow: 1-star: I hate it; 2-stars: I
don’t like it; 3-stars: It’s OK; 4-stars: I like it; 5-stars: I love it.

- **Ordinal:** In the most cases, this form is used via questionnaire where the customer
is asked to indicate his opinions about an item as follow:1-strongly agree; 2-
agree; 3-neutral; 4-disagree; 5-strongly disagree.

- **Binary:** This form is used to simply ask the user about his opinions for a collection
of item while the user should not express his degree of interests, he just accepts or
refuses the itemby saying this item is good or it is bad.

- **Unary:** This form indicates that the user has selected or rated an item positively.
The absence of a rating assumes that we have no information relating the user to the
item.

#### 2.2- Implicit Data
In most cases, it is not necessary that users rate all items they have bought or viewed
because they spend their time rating items or do not see the point of doing. Hence, it
is necessary to overcome the lack of the sufficient information in seeking to construct the user’s model. For this purpose, we can infer an implicit rating via studying different
patterns behaviors about the user where the system deduces their information by
analysing server logs, the time spent on a particular web page or search and browsing
history.

### 3- General Process
Aswe mentioned before, the recommendation approaches can be classified according
to the data sources they use. This data can be acquired in different ways and it is
also characterised by three sources types of information that can be used in the
recommendation process which are the item data (e.g. keywords), the user data (e.g.
age, types, level of studies) and the user-item ratings (e.g. obtained from transaction
data, explicit ratings).

The success of each RS depends on its ability to represent user’s potential interests
accurately. Obviously, it is necessary to keep a profile with updated information about
the user’s preferences to decide which items suit better his/her taste. By these means,
RSs collect relevant information about their users to generate their corresponding profiles
for the prediction tasks of behaviors or content of the resources the user accesses.
Generally, every RS follows a specialized process in order to provide recommendations
as follow:

</div>

- **Information collection phase:**
As a first step in the recommendation process, RS requires to collect as much information
as possible about each user to build a user profile or a user model which contains
user’s interests, opinions, preferences and cognitive skills in order to provide reasonable
recommendations.

- **Learning phase:**
This step is represented as a discover and pattern phase. It is used to filter and exploit
the user’s interests from the feedback gathered in information collection phase.

- **Prediction/Recommendation phase:**
This step recommends what kind of items the user may prefer. The recommendation
phase is used to match he user’s preferences and the items which compromise
the highest scores discovered in the two previous phases.

- **Satisfaction degree/Feedback:**
This step is used to measure the impact of the users’ feedback about the recommendations.
It is also a method to collect more information about users to provide more
satisfactory recommendations in the future.

### 4- Major Recommendation Approaches
RSs have been actively and extensively studied over the years. They present a multidisciplinary
field which is supporting individuals who lack sufficient personal skills to
evaluate overwhelming number of alternative items that an online website can offer in
finding items of interest. The choice of such RS approach has an important effect upon
user satisfaction. Usually, themost popularwebsites apply RS to personalize the online
store for each user but they can also apply non personalized way for recommendations.

The personalized filtering is a technique which is mostly used in seeking to predict
the user’s personality and to derive its personality based item preferences. It is represented
as ranked lists of items which are based on the user’s preferences. Thus, it can
infer the user’s preferences not only by the initial information that he provides explicitly,
but also by analysing his profile and comparing it with similar profiles.

The non-personalized recommendations are represented as the most simple recommendation
approach. It recommends the suitable items that are based on the viewpoints
or the feedback of other users on average. Hence, the realisation of this approach
is very simple because the data is easy to collect. Moreover, this automatic
systems do not require an interaction between the user and the system, so they do not
require also a user’smodel. In addition, each recommendation is completely independent
of the user, so the recommendations may be identical for each one. Generally,
this approach can be based on the top-N items or the popularity of items (e.g. average
ratings, sales data and total visits).

It is very important to use the efficient recommendation techniques in order to provide
the best and useful suggestions for users. For this reason, it is important to understand
which information will be exploited by the system and when it will be generated.
In general, experts classify these techniques into several categories by analysing and filtering the data sources through Internet according to multiple criteria like user preferences
and types of feedbacks.

The content-based, collaborative filtering and hybrid approaches are broadly considered
as the most important and familiar ones. The content-based filtering is a technique which retrieves items similar to
the user’s profile, whereas the collaborative filtering technique allows to identify users
with similar preferences to the given user’s preferences and recommend items they
have liked. For the last types, it represents a combination between the two previous
approaches in order to overcome their weaknesses. In the next subsections, we will
discuss the features and the main proposals of each recommendation technique.

<img src="/assets/chap3/2.PNG" style="border:none; width:100%;">
</div>

#### 4.1- Content-based Recommender System
Content-based (CB) recommender system focuses on content or description of items
in seeking to suggest recommendations fromthe user’s preferences profiles. This filtering
technique allows to collect the user’s information by analyzing the user’s behavior
or by asking the user explicitly about his priorities in order to construct a user’s model.
The key component of this technique is the construction of the user’s model from the
user’s preferences. Therefore, RS must require several information about the user’s interaction
with RS and even about the user’s history.

The content-based filtering technique considers the user queries and the items
contents in their recommendations and ignores any contributions coming from third part like the case of collaborative technique. The delivered recommendations,
here, are just provided according to the interaction between the system and the user’s
profile. Furthermore, the CB recommendation can be also based on the items which
are already rated positively by the user in the past in order to compare them with the
items that he has not rated yet. Hence, the recommendations are represented in the
formof similar items that a given user has yet liked.

<div class="imgcap">
<img src="/assets/chap3/3.PNG" style="border:none; width:100%;">
</div>

User independence is considered as an important aspect of CBF recommendation. It has the capability
to recommend item with unique taste provided by an active user using ratings. More
specifically, the active user does not need data from other users, his recommendation
will be just based on his own preferences. Further, we can consider transparency as
an other advantage of CBF. Using this feature, RSs can provide explanations for recommended
items by listing content-features that caused an item to be recommended.
Next advantage of CBF that is called new item, CB recommendation, here, can suggested
items before being rated for an important number of users.

The CBF methods are also suffer from various limitations. Generally, the CBF
approach is mostly dependent on items’ metadata. Therefore, it requires rich description
about items in order to discriminate the taste of the user and construct a good
user profile for him. This problem is called limited content analysis. We can also mention
the content over-specialization as another serious problem of CBF technique. It
recommends suggestionswith a limited degree of novelty for the reason that is not possible
to have suggestions not already aware. The recommended items, here, are characterised
by very high scores which are mostly similar to the items already positively
rated.

#### 4.2- Collaborative Recommender System:
The collaborative filtering techniques (CF) is considered as the most popular implemented
techniques in RSs. CF is a process of filtering information which provides
collaboration among various data sources, agents, viewpoints, etc. This algorithmcan
recommend items that the user has not rated before, but that were positively rated by
users in neighborhood in the past.

<div class="imgcap">
<img src="/assets/chap3/4.PNG" style="border:none; width:100%;">
</div>

In the recommendation systems, the CF methods is widely divided into two categories
user-based CF and item-based CF.

**User-based collaborative filtering:** This approach computes the correlation
with all other users for each item and aggregate the rating of highly correlated users as
depicted in figure below.

<div class="imgcap">
<img src="/assets/chap3/5.PNG" style="border:none; width:100%;">
</div>

**Item-based collaborative filtering:** This approach computes for each user
item the correlation with all other items and aggregates for each user the ratings for
items that are already highly correlated as depicted in this figure.

<div class="imgcap">
<img src="/assets/chap3/6.PNG" style="border:none; width:100%;">
</div>

The CF technique has some major advantages over CBF in that it can perform in
domains where there is not much content associated with items and the content is
difficult to analyze for the computer system. Thus, we should mention that the CF
technique is just based on groups of users with similar preferences in the recommendation
process and it does not require the representation of items. So, it has the ability
to provide relevant recommendations without using the content in the user’s profile.
Despite its success, their widespread has revealed some potential problems such
as:

- **Cold-start problem**, it is one of the major problems which reduces the efficiency
and the performance of every RS. It presents the case where a RS does not have an
adequate information about an item or a user in order to make relevant predictions.
Hence, the user’s profile will be empty since the user has not rated any item before and
the taste is not identified.

- **Data sparsity problem**, it is considered as a result of the lack of insufficient information
when only few items of the total information available in a database are rated
by the users.

- **Synonymy**, it is that some added terms may have different meanings from what
is intended, which sometimes leads to rapid degradation of recommendation performance.
Mostly, RSs find synonymy difficult to deduce distinction between closely related
items. They apply different methods to overcome this problemlike the construction
of thesaurus, automatic termexpansion and Latent Semantic Indexing.


#### 4.3- Hybrid Recommender System:
It is another important approach of RSs which overcomes the weaknesses of the
two other approaches. It combines two or more recommendations techniques to obtain
a better optimization reducing the limitations of pure recommendation systems. The idea behind hybrid approach is that a combination of techniques will provide
more effective suggestions than a single algorithm as the drawbacks of one algorithm
can be overcome by another one. Thus, Themost popular hybrid approaches are those
of the system based on content and the system based on collaborative. This combination
of approaches can proceed in different ways:

1. Separate implementation of algorithms and joining the results.
2. Utilize some rules of content-based filtering in collaborative approach.
3. Utilize some rules of collaborative filtering in content-based approach.
4. Create a unified RS that brings together both approaches.

The most important advantage of this hybridized system is being characterised
by a high accuracy recommendations unlike the other techniques. This technique is
also considered as a solution of a cold start problem due to short user profiles and the
availability of sparse ratings of a user that can be handled effectively by using hybrid
recommendation system. The hybridized approach achieves several strategies which
are broadly classified as follow:

- Weighted: The score of different recommendation components are combined
together to provide a single suggestion.

- Switching: The system chooses among recommendation components and
applies the selected one depending on the current situation.

- Mixed: Recommendations fromdifferent recommenders are presented at the
same time.

- Feature Combination: Features derived from several data sources are combined
together and given to a single recommendation algorithm.

- Feature Augmentation: One recommendation technique is used to compute
a feature or a set of features, which is then used as an input to another technique.

- Cascade: Recommenders refines the recommendations given by another technique.

- Meta-level: One recommendation technique is applied and produces some
sort of model’s, which are then the input used by the next technique.

### 5- Properties of Recommender Systems:

The success of each RS depends on the efficiency that can be measured in terms of RSs
properties. In order to specify the performance of such system, we should measure the
closeness of the estimated preferences and the actual preferences of a user. Different
approaches have been adopted several properties to evaluate the performance of recommendation
systems like accuracy, privacy, diversity, etc. It is important to highlight that we should consider the existed trade-off present between properties to establish a
good evaluation. For instance we can consider accuracy less important to some others
properties like diversity or privacy and vice versa. In this section, we mention some
properties of RSs to clarify their impacts on users like:

- **User preference:** It allows to provide a list of ranked items through an important
number of existing products. This property aims at supporting user to find and collect
knowledge about themost suitable product efficiently andmore quickly.

- **Prediction Accuracy:** The main objective of this property is to suggest accurate
recommendations that are represented as the most suitable ones for the user. This
property is related to a prediction engine which delivers the items that present the
user’s opinions and interests.

- **Privacy:** Using this property, the recommender should establish the privacy of
the user’s profiles and preferences. The main objective of this property is to deliver secret
recommendations where no third party can access and use the profile of a specific
user.

- **Trust:** It refers to the users trust in the recommendations provided by RS. To enhance
trust, RS recommends some reasonable items which are already selected and
known in order to increase trust in the system recommendations for unknown items
as well as the interaction between the system and the user is the basis of building this
trust.

- **Robustness:** It is related to the stability of the recommendation in the presence
of fake information typically inserted on purpose in order to influence the recommendations.
RS should create a system which is immune to any type of unrealistic attack.
In this context, the attack refers to the influence used by injecting fake users’ profiles
to influence and to try changing the rating of an item.

- **Novelty:** Novel recommendations are the recommendations of products or services
which the user did not select or know yet. The best approach to deliver novel
recommendations is not to filter out items but to collect the information that could be
implemented. Thus, RS can also recommend popular items less likely in order to deliver
for their user a novel recommendation.

- **Serendipity:** It is a pleasant surprise of recommendation system results. For instance,
a user has ranked a list of his preferred songs, the system recommends him a
new song which may be new, so the user will be surprised because he may not be informed
about it. In some cases, the random suggestions may be surprise and satisfy
the user but it should require the balance between the accuracy and the serendipity.

- **Diversity:** It is commonly defined as the average pairwise distance between
recommendations to users. The diversification of these recommendations aims
at enhancing the user’s experience and expertise. Frequently, the algorithms proposed in the RSs literature allow to maximize the recommendations accuracy. However, in
most cases, recommending a set of similar items is insufficient and not profitable for
the users, and it is not enough to judge the effectiveness of RSs. It can also causing
user dissatisfaction and frustration. Therefore, the key of these situations is should be
consider diversity to meet user’s satisfaction.
